            At <strong>Capital Interior</strong>, we don't just decorate homes — we design experiences.
            We specialize in personalized interior solutions that blend function, style, and soul.
            With every project, we aim to create spaces that feel warm, purposeful, and deeply
            connected to the people who live in them.
          </p>
          <p>
            Whether it’s a cozy studio apartment or a sprawling luxury residence, our
            approach is always rooted in listening, understanding, and customizing. We begin
            by getting to know your lifestyle, your preferences, and your vision — then translate it
            into elegant, livable designs that are both timeless and trend-aware.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our team of experienced designers, craftsmen, and project managers works
            together to provide seamless, turnkey solutions — from layout planning and material
            selection to execution and styling. Every detail, from the lighting in your foyer to
            the texture of your bedroom wall, is thoughtfully designed to reflect your story.
          </p>
          <p>
            We also integrate Vastu principles, sustainable practices, and space-optimizing
            techniques, ensuring our designs are not only beautiful but also balanced, efficient,
            and future-ready.
